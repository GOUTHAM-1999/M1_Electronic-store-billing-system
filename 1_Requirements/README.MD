**INTRODUCTION**

Most of these days, we hear lot of accidents due to drunken driving. Drunken drivers will not be in stable condition and so the rash driving is the inconvenience for other road users and also question of life and death for the drunken driver and for others.

**OBJECTIVE**

In this project, we are developing an Auto Lock System. Alcohol sensor is interfaced to microcontroller. While alcohol wafers smelled by the sensor. Sensor sends the input voltage to micro controller. If there are any traces of Alcohol above the set limit, then the system will lock the Engine at the same time will automatically gives a buzzer. We can avoid accidents by checking the driving people on the roads. So that we can avoid accidents.
